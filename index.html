		<p><span id="intro">Our visit to Brown University’s B Lab VC Workshop</span> was insightful and informative, a lens into a world few have the honor and privilege to venture (no pun intended).  We heard from Bain Capital’s Scott Friend as he described Venture Capital from his side of the table. We usually read about VC from a reporter’s perspective, third-hand, as you might find in the Financial Times or Entrepreneur Magazine.  Many thanks to our host Jason Harry, PhD, Associate Professor of the Practice School of Engineering, for allowing us into his class and meet many of the world's rising entrepeneural stars, his students.</p>
		<p>One of Scott’s comments stuck in my mind: he’s particularly interested when he sees someone with a keen insight into some topic that they have experienced or researched themselves. Those are opportunities that possess a personal enthusiasm; it’s more than just a job for them.</p>
		<p>Another thing he said was that VC a two-way street, that the entrepreneur has to carefully consider their investor too, because you are going to be stuck with this person for a long time, and if he’s a jerk you may not want to deal with him. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxBZEkQoDpr7bFBtbzZENEFwVVE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here’s a little video clip</a> of Scott describing that thought.</p>
